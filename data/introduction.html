            <p>Ubuntu MATE is an operating system -- software that runs your
              computer, like <a href="cmd://link?http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft's
                Windows</a>, <a href="cmd://link?http://www.apple.com">Apple's
                Mac&nbsp; OSX</a> or <a href="cmd://link?http://www.google.com/chrome">Google's
                ChromeOS</a>. Ubuntu MATE is distribution (version) of Linux, a
              dependable, secure, capable, and modern computer system that
              rivals all others in popularity and actual use. </p>
            <p>Unlike those other three, Linux is a major operating system that
              is used:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>on most of the world's fastest and most powerful
                supercomputers</li>
              <li>on many of (if not most of) the computers that make up the
                backbone of Internet</li>
              <li>and on corporate servers that require stability and
                reliability</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Ubuntu MATE is a stable, easy-to-use operating system with a
              configurable desktop environment. It is ideal for those who want
              the most out of their computers and prefer a traditional desktop
              metaphor. With modest hardware requirements, it is suitable for
              modern desktops and laptops, micro computers (such as the
              Raspberry Pi 2) and older hardware alike.</p>
            <p>The operating system is more secure, and better supported than
              the operating system pre-installed on most home computer hardware
              today. </p>
            <p>Using Ubuntu MATE provides you with the freedom to run a
              complete, full-featured operating system, pre-configured with
              most, if not all, of the applications you will need for your daily
              computing, or to change anything about the way it looks, the way
              it works, or the applications it runs to suit your taste. </p>
            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <p>Ubuntu MATE has a number of guiding objectives and goals:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Accessible to all, regardless of language and physical
                ability.</li>
              <li>Increase both Ubuntu and MATE Desktop user adoption.</li>
              <li>Ubuntu alternative for computers that aren't powerful enough
                to run a composited desktop.</li>
              <li>First choice Ubuntu platform for remote workstation solutions
                such as LTSP and X2Go.</li>
              <li>Recreate the halcyon days of Ubuntu for users who prefer a
                traditional desktop metaphor.</li>
              <li>Use themes and artwork similar to Ubuntu so that Ubuntu MATE
                is immediately familiar.</li>
              <li>When possible contribute to Debian so both the Debian and
                Ubuntu communities benefit.</li>
              <li>Software selection will favour functionality and stability
                over lightness and whimsy.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>What is Ubuntu MATE?</h2>
            <h3>Ubuntu</h3>
            <img class="left" src="img/logos/ubuntu.png" alt="Ubuntu" height="100"
              width="100">
            <p><a href="cmd://link?http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> is one of,
              if not the, largest deployed <a href="cmd://link?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a>
              based desktop operating systems in the world. Linux is at the
              heart of Ubuntu and makes it possible to create secure, powerful
              and versatile operating systems, such as Ubuntu and <a href="cmd://link?http://www.android.com/">Android</a>.
              Android is now in the hands of billions of people around the world
              and it's also powered by Linux.</p>
            <p>Ubuntu is available in a number of different <em>flavours</em>,
              each coming with its own desktop environment. Ubuntu MATE takes
              the Ubuntu base operating system and adds the <a href="cmd://link?http://mate-desktop.org">MATE
                Desktop</a>.</p>
            <h3>MATE Desktop</h3>
            <p>Wikipedia says that <a href="cmd://link?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment">a
                Desktop Environment is</a>:</p>
            <blockquote>an implementation of the desktop metaphor made of a
              bundle of programs running on top of a computer operating system,
              which share a common graphical user interface (GUI). Desktop GUIs
              help the user to easily access and edit files. </blockquote>
            <img class="right" src="img/logos/mate.png" alt="MATE Desktop" height="100"
              width="100">
            <p>The MATE Desktop is one such implementation of a desktop
              environment and includes a file manager which can connect you to
              your local and networked files, a text editor, calculator, archive
              manager, image viewer, document viewer, system monitor and
              terminal. All of which are highly customisable and managed via a
              control centre.</p>
            <p>MATE Desktop provides an intuitive and attractive desktop
              environment using traditional metaphors, which means if you've
              ever used <a href="cmd://link?http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft
                Windows</a> or <a href="cmd://link?http://www.apple.com">Apple
                Mac OS</a>, it will feel very familiar.</p>
            <p>The MATE Desktop has a rich history and is the continuation of
              the GNOME2 desktop, which was the default desktop environment on
              many Linux and Unix operating systems for over a decade. This
              means that MATE Desktop is tried, tested and very reliable.</p>
            <h3>Open Source</h3>
            <img class="left" src="./img/logos/osi.png" alt="Open Source Initiative"
              height="150" width="150">
            <p>What Linux, Ubuntu and MATE Desktop all have in common is they
              are Open Source. Open source software is software that can be
              freely used, changed, and shared (in modified or unmodified form)
              by anyone. In a nutshell Ubuntu MATE is free, in the truest sense
              of the word.</p>
            <p>Although you will find some versions (distributions) of Linux for
              purchase, the vast majority are provided free of charge, like
              Ubuntu MATE. Open Source software is licensed in a way that allows
              anyone to give it away for free, no strings attached. For example,
              the licence gives any member of the user community the freedom to
              use Linux for any purpose, to distribute, modify, redistribute, or
              even sell the operating system. If you do modify and then
              redistribute Linux with your modifications, you are required by
              the licence to submit your modifications for possible inclusion
              into future versions. There is no guarantee that this will ever
              happen, but if you have made it better, then your changes just
              might be included in the next release of Ubuntu MATE. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;Many of the users of Linux are corporations that use the
              operating system to run their businesses, or include it within
              their products. Many of these corporations provide fixes and new
              features for Linux as they use the software for their businesses.
              <a href="cmd://link?http://www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/infographics/who-writes-linux-2015">These
                improvements are given back</a> to the Linux community and
              Ubuntu MATE improves as a result. This is how we can continually
              improve and grow without having to charge our users money.<br>
              <br>
              Unlike Windows, and OSX,&nbsp; Linux is not created and supported
              by just one company. It is supported by Intel, Redhat, Linaro,
              Samsung, IBM, SUSE, Texas Instruments, Google, Canonical, Oracle,
              AMD, and Microsoft. Over 4,000 developers contributed to Linux
              over the last 15 years.<br>
              <br>
              Whether you are a home user of Ubuntu MATE, a Ubuntu MATE software
              or application developer, or an employee of an organisation that
              uses the operating system, you are a member of the Linux and Open
              Source communities and benefit from the efforts of the developers
              who contribute to Ubuntu MATE and its related projects, Linux,
              MATE, and Ubuntu.&nbsp; Members of the community can and do run
              Linux on almost any hardware, from the prettiest Macbook to the
              cheapest netbook, from the newest Chromebook to some very old
              machines designed for Windows, and from the most powerful Internet
              servers to the smallest smart thermostat. </p>
