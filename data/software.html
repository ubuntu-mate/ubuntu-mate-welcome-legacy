          collection of wiki pages. Each page can contain links to
          other pages, simple formatting and inline images. Pages are
          stored in a folder structure, like in an outliner, and can
          have attachments. Creating a new page is as easy as linking
          to a nonexistent page. All data is stored in plain text files
          with wiki formatting. Various plugins provide additional
          functionality, like a task list manager, an equation editor,
          a tray icon, and support for version control. Zim can be used
          to: Keep an archive of notes, Take notes during meetings or
          lectures, Organize task lists, Draft blog entries and emails,

          At first, people built structures to protect against nocturnal monsters,
          but as the game grew players worked together to create wonderful, imaginative
          things. It can also be about adventuring with friends or watching the sun
          rise over a blocky ocean. It’s pretty. Brave players battle terrible things
          in The Nether, which is more scary than pretty. You can also visit a land of
          mushrooms if it sounds more like your cup of tea.</p>

          <p><b>Darktable</b> is a virtual lighttable and darkroom for
          photographers. Darktable manages your digital negatives in a
          database and lets you view them  through a zoomable
          lighttable. it also enables you to develop raw images and
          enhance them.  It tries to fill the gap between the many
          excellent existing free raw converters and image management
          tools (such as ufraw or f-spot). The user interface is built
          around efficient caching of image metadata and mipmaps, all
          stored in a database. the user will always be able to
          interact, even if the full resolution image is not yet
          loaded.  All editing is fully non-destructive and only
          operates on cached image buffers for display. the full image
          is only converted during export. High-dynamic range, and standard
          image formats such as jpeg are also supported. The core operates
          completely on floating point values, so darktable can not
          only be used for photography but also for scientifically
          acquired images or output of renderers (high dynamic
          range).</p>

          <p><b>Bleachbit</b> deletes unnecessary files to free valuable disk space, maintain
          privacy, and remove junk. It removes cache, Internet history, temporary files, cookies, and broken
          shortcuts. Beyond simply erasing junk files, BleachBit wipes free disk space (to hide
          previously deleted files for privacy and to improve compression of images), vacuums
          Firefox databases (to improve performance without deleting data), and securely shreds arbitrary files.</p>
